\SectionTitle[.025in]{Summary}

I'm a software engineer with over a decade of experience. I specialize in creating performant, scalable solutions that exceed user expectations. My technical expertise is complemented by a strong commitment to community service, exemplified by my ongoing role as an organizer and instructor at the Utah Refugee Center, where I mentor aspiring developers.

\vspace{.1in}

I'm deeply passionate about software design and architecture, distributed systems, and PLT. What I value most from my place of work is: the people that I work with, the products or services we're providing, and the technical challenges we're solving. I'm eager to find a place where these elements converge.

% My career highlights include leading the development of a financial feed product that secured a \$3 million contract and optimizing critical endpoints to reduce response times significantly.

\SectionTitle{Summary}

I am incredibly passionate about Computer Science and Software Engineering.
Even if money wasnâ€™t a concern I would still be programming. While I enjoy
working on a range of CS related topics, my main area of interest right
now is language design and implementation. I also volunteer at the Refugee
Education and Training Center of Utah as an organizer and teacher for
programming classes, and mentor students throughout the week.


\SectionTitle{Skills}

Scala, Go, Ruby, Python, TypeScript/JavaScript, Elm, bash, Linux, software
design and architecture, process automation, continuous integration,
distributed systems, planning and project management.

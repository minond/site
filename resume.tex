\SectionTitle[.1in]{Summary}

With over a decade of hands-on experience in frontend and backend application
development and system design, I bring a deep-rooted passion for computer
science and software engineering to the table. My commitment to programming
is unwavering, driven by an innate curiosity that goes beyond money. With a
focus in building performant and scalable solutions, my expertise lies at the
intersection of innovation and practicality.

\vspace{.08in}

Beyond my technical prowess, I extend my impact to the community by
volunteering at the Utah Refugee Center. Here, I take on roles as an
organizer and instructor for programming courses, shaping the next generation
of aspiring developers through guidance and mentorship.

\SectionTitle{Independent Work}

I've independently developed compilers and programming languages featuring
Hindleyâ€“Milner type inference, custom opcode instruction sets, multi-pass
compilation, and integration with LLVM. My projects demonstrate experience
and knowledge in formal language specifications, parsing, syntax and semantic
analysis, and code generation.

\DescribedEntry{Software Engineer, Freelance}{Minond, LLC}{January 2023 - Present}{
  As a freelance software engineer, I've engaged in diverse projects encompassing personal initiatives and contract work.

\DescribedEntry{Staff Software Engineer}{MX}{April 2018 - December 2022}{
  Played an active part in shaping our platform as both an individual contributor and a mentor to individuals and teams designing and developing solutions for a rapidly evolving industry and ecosystem.
  \begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{.0in}
    \item Member of the Enterprise Technical Office group where I dealt with high urgency client requirements and advised in project architecture and problem solving platform-wide.
    \item Conceived and led initiative to improve our client's developer experience, shortening part of the implementation process from an average of two weeks down to 6 hours. This included building SDKs for major mobile platforms. Evangelized this team's solutions and enhancements to internal and external parties.
    \item Technical lead to over a dozen backend and frontend engineers in the design and development of MXinsights, a financial feed product serving over 7 million users at the time of my departure. This product helped us to break into a new market by securing a contract exceeding \$3 million with one of Canada's largest banks.
    \item Optimized critical endpoints, reducing average response times from 100ms to under 10ms. These endpoints served as the backbone for the entire platform and are used by all of our products.

  \DescribedEntry{Software Engineer, Tech Lead}{Domo, Inc.}{December 2014 - May 2017}{
    I started at Domo working on new features as a front-end engineer. I worked on a new zero state experience for the product, a report builder and scheduler, and more. I then joined another team as a backend Scala engineer and later became that team's lead. Got to learn a lot in this position, such as why good logging is a wonderful thing.

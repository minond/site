\SectionTitle[.1in]{Summary}

With over a decade of hands-on experience in frontend and backend application
development and system design, I bring a deep-rooted passion for computer
science and software engineering to the table. My commitment to programming
is unwavering, driven by an innate curiosity that goes beyond money. With a
focus in building performant and scalable solutions, my expertise lies at the
intersection of innovation and practicality.

\vspace{.08in}

Beyond my technical prowess, I extend my impact to the community by
volunteering at the Utah Refugee Center. Here, I take on roles as an
organizer and instructor for programming courses, shaping the next generation
of aspiring developers through guidance and mentorship.

\SectionTitle{Skills}

Scala, Go, Ruby, Python, TypeScript/JavaScript, Elm, bash, Linux, software
design and architecture, compilers, parsing, codegen, process automation,
continuous integration, distributed systems, observability, project management.

\SectionTitle{Independent Work}

I've independently developed compilers and programming languages featuring
Hindleyâ€“Milner type inference, custom opcode instruction sets, multi-pass
compilation, and integration with LLVM. My projects demonstrate experience
and knowledge in formal language specifications, parsing, syntax and semantic
analysis, and code generation.

  \DescribedEntry{Software Engineer, Tech Lead}{Domo, Inc.}{December 2014 - May 2017}{
    I started at Domo working on new features as a front-end engineer. I worked on a new zero state experience for the product, a report builder and scheduler, and more. I then joined another team as a backend Scala engineer and later became that team's lead. Got to learn a lot in this position, such as why good logging is a wonderful thing.

    Lead of the PowerStandings team. Worked with my team to making the MVP production ready, improving the interface and user experience, and making the application standalone.

    Worked on bring in a more "DevOps-y" mindset into the department. Helped improve the development and deployment process for lots of services. Learned a lot about ops, systems, Linux.
    \\ \vspace{.08in}
    I worked on new features for our LMP product. Some of these were a custom report engine and an intelligent data deduplication tool. The Intelligent Deduplication project was one of my favorites. It was able to take a client's database, search for duplicate records by comparing multiple data points, then merge all the data, which spanned across multiple tables, into a new record. The client had the ability to customize the way the searching and merging algorithms worked, and they were also able to un-merge records afterwards.

  \DescribedEntry{Implementation Team Member \& Manager}{InsideSales.com}{January 2009 - December 2011}{
    I managed a team of Implementation Technicians. As a team we made further improvements to my previous work. One of the biggest takeaways from this position was that I learned how to breakdown big jobs into smaller tasks so that they could be worked on by a team.
    \\ \vspace{.08in}
    Along with my managerial responsibilities and helping with the day-to-day work, I also trained all new members and made sure quality standard were met.
    \\ \vspace{.08in}
    I took care of all of the technological aspects of the implementation. This included, but was not limited to, things such as data imports and automated sanitation, inbound and outbound call-flow setup, automated work flows, and some custom development as well.
    \\ \vspace{.08in}
    I joined the department when it was first being created, so I was a big part in helping the department grow. I helped by creating the processes and standards that would later be followed by the team I managed. This was my first exposure to a professional environment, and it was a great learning experience. This is also the job that got me interested in programming.

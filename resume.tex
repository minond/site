\SectionTitle{Summary}

I am incredibly passionate about Computer Science and Software Engineering.
Even if money wasnâ€™t a concern I would still be programming. While I enjoy
working on a range of CS related topics, my biggest area of interest right
now is language design and implementation. I also volunteer at the Refugee
Education and Training Center of Utah as an organizer and teacher for
programming classes, and mentor students throughout the week.

Go, Scala, TypeScript, JavaScript, Node.js, Elm, React, D3.js, bash, PHP,
Linux, software design, process automation, continuous integration, distributed
systems.

          <h2 class="mt3 mb3 f7 ttu">Summary</h2>
          <p class="f7">
            I am incredibly passionate about programming.  Even if money wasn&rsquo;t a
            concern I would still be programming.
          </p>
          <p class="f7">
            While I enjoy working on a range of CS related topics, my biggest area of
            interest right now is language design and implementation.
          </p>
          <p class="f7">
            I also volunteer at the Refugee Education and Training Center of Utah as
            an organizer and teacher for programming classes, and mentor students
            throughout the week.

            I organize and help teach a class for refugees with a wide range of
            programming experience (zero programming experience to professional
            programmers). The course lasts about 12 months and ends with the student
            taking the Oracle Certified Associate Java SE 8 Programmer Test. Along
            with programming skills related to Java and other parts of the job, we
            help students with soft skills and networking.

          <div class="f7">May 2017 - April 2018 (1 year)</div>
          <p class="f7">
            Previous positions have given me experience in breaking down problems,
            developing ideas, proving they are good and worth working on, converting
            them down into manageable tasks, and, of course, making them real. I help
            companies do these things.

          <div class="f7">December 2014 - May 2017 (2 years 6 months)</div>
          <p class="f7">
            I started at Domo working on new features as a front-end engineer. Among
            others, those features included a new zero state experience for the
            product, an automated report scheduler, and also building out the code
            infrastructure for automated end-to-end UI tests. I then moved to another
            team to work as a Scala programmer and ended up taking over that team as
            the team lead. Got to learn a lot in this position, such as why good
            logging is a wonderful thing.

          <div class="f7">January 2014 - November 2014 (11 months)</div>
          <p class="f7">
            Team Lead of the PowerStandings team. The code and product quality are
            the first priority, and our build process is always as automated as
            possible. I have given trainings and written documentation so other teams
            can start to incorporate some of the technologies my team uses (e.g.
            AngularJS, SASS, Grunt, bower).

          <div class="f7 i mt3"><span class="fw6">DevOps Engineer</span>, InsideSales.com</div>
          <div class="f7">June 2013 - January 2014 (8 months)</div>
          <p class="f7">
            I was tasked with heading the newly created DevOps team to help improve
            the department&rsquo;s development process. While in this position, I trained
            and gave my co-workers the tools needed to be able to automatically test
            and check the quality of their code. I came up with coding standard,
            style guides, and setup Go and Jenkins jobs to run tests and deploy our
            applications to QA environments.
          </p>

          <div class="f7">January 2012 - June 2013 (1 year 6 months)</div>
          <p class="f7">
            I worked on new features for our LMP product and Salesforce application.
            A product named Intelligent Dedupe was one of my favorite to work on; It
            was able to take a client&rsquo;s database, search for duplicate records by
            comparing multiple data points, and then merge all the data - which
            spanned across multiple tables - into a new record. The client had the
            ability to customize the way the searching and merging algorithms worked,
            and they were also able to un-merge records afterwards.
          </p>

          <div class="f7 i mt3"><span class="fw6">Implementation Team Member &amp; Manager</span>, InsideSales.com</div>
          <div class="f7">January 2009 - December 2011 (3 years)</div>
          <p class="f7">
            I joined the department when it was first being created so I was an
            integral part in helping the department grow. I helped by creating the
            processes and standards that would later be followed by the team I
            managed. I took care of all of the technological aspects of
            implementation. One of the biggest takeaways from this position was that
            I learned how to breakdown big jobs into smaller tasks in order to be
            worked on by a team.
